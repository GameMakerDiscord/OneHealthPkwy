## Overview

The purpose of *1 Health Pkwy* (henceforth, *1HP*) is to run the hospital as long as possible without
suffering from a loss of a single patient's life. Each turn, the player may buy one new room to build
in her hospital, hire one new doctor (most likely for the room just purchased), and place as many 
patients as possible in appropriate rooms according to their ailing complaints. 

A successful cure leads to profits, profits which can then be spent on MORE rooms and MORE doctors, oh
wonderous healthcare system, are you ever without surprises?

### Gameplay

At *Game Start* players are given a Reception Area with which to receive thier patients, and a General 
Practice for the basic needs of diagnosis.
